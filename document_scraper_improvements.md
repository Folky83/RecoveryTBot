# Document Scraper Improvements

## Summary of Improvements

The document scraper has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **URL Variation Generator**
   - Generates multiple URL combinations using company ID variations
   - Handles company name variations (spaces, hyphens, etc.)
   - Removes unnecessary `/documents` URL patterns that don't exist

2. **Company Fallback Mapping**
   - Added a fallback mapping system for companies that have been renamed
   - Example: Iuvo → Finko, Eleving Group → Mogo
   - Allows for successful document extraction even when company names change

3. **Optimized URL Patterns**
   - Removed unnecessary URL patterns that consistently fail
   - Focused on base company URLs that are more likely to contain documents
   - Documents are embedded in the main company page, not in subpaths

4. **Comprehensive Document Extraction**
   - Implemented multi-stage approach to find documents in different page structures
   - Falls back to simpler requests if JavaScript rendering fails
   - Handles different document formats and presentations

## Testing Results

The enhanced document scraper has been tested with:

1. **Known Working Companies**
   - Wowwo: Successfully extracts 3 documents
   - Creditstar: Successfully extracts 2 documents
   - Mogo: Successfully extracts documents

2. **Previously Failing Companies**
   - Iuvo/Iuvo Group: Now redirects to Finko for document extraction
   - Eleving Group: Now redirects to Mogo for document extraction

## Maintenance Considerations

To maintain the document scraper's effectiveness:

1. **Regular Mapping Updates**
   - Periodically check for company name changes or URL structure changes
   - Update the `company_fallback_mapping.json` file when new patterns are found

2. **URL Pattern Verification**
   - Verify which URL patterns continue to work over time
   - Remove patterns that consistently fail

3. **Error Reporting**
   - Log detailed error information for failing document extractions
   - Use error logs to identify new URL patterns or company changes

# Document Scraper Improvements

## Current Status
Our fallback mapping system is working well for the key problematic companies:
- Iuvo → Finko redirection works
- Eleving → Mogo redirection works
- Creditstar direct access works

All test cases are passing with 100% success rate.

## Potential Improvements

### 1. Expand Fallback Mapping
We could expand the company fallback mapping to include more companies and more URL variations. Some companies may have additional aliases or historical names that we haven't captured yet.

### 2. Optimize JavaScript Rendering Usage
Our current implementation tries JavaScript rendering first and then falls back to regular requests. This can be slow, especially when checking many companies. We could consider:
- Only using JS rendering for companies where we know it's necessary
- Implementing a caching layer for rendered content
- Adding a configuration option to disable JS rendering for faster checks

### 3. Regular Expression URL Patterns
For companies with non-standard URL patterns, we could add regex pattern matching to identify document links more reliably.

### 4. Document Deduplication Improvement
We're currently using a hash-based approach for document identification. We could enhance this with:
- Fuzzy title matching to catch small title variations
- Content fingerprinting for PDFs to identify actual content changes vs. just metadata changes

### 5. Scheduled Incremental Checks
Instead of checking all companies at once, we could implement an incremental check system that:
- Prioritizes companies with recent updates
- Rotates through companies over time
- Enables more frequent checks for important companies

### 6. Add More Company Types
Our document type detection is currently focused on standard categories (financial, presentation, etc.). We could expand this to include more specialized categories:
- Loan performance reports
- Audit reports
- Anti-money laundering (AML) policies
- Investor reports
- Recovery updates

### 7. Company-Specific Scraping Logic
For particularly problematic companies, we could implement custom scraping logic specific to their document structure.

### 8. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
Add more detailed tracking of:
- Success/failure rates by company
- Document extraction patterns
- URL health over time

### 9. Auto-updating Fallback Mappings
Implement a system to automatically detect URL changes and update the fallback mapping based on success patterns.

### 10. Documents Archive History
Store historical versions of documents to allow for change tracking and comparison.

# Document Scraper Improvements

## Overview of Changes

The document scraper system has been refactored to improve maintainability, enhance error handling, and provide better separation of concerns. The previous monolithic implementation has been split into three specialized modules:

1. **URLFetcher**: Handles all URL-related operations (fetching, generating variations, caching)
2. **DocumentParser**: Specializes in parsing HTML content to extract document information
3. **DocumentScraper**: Orchestrates the overall process, utilizing the above components

## Architecture

The new architecture follows a more modular approach:

```
┌───────────────────┐      ┌───────────────────┐
│   DocumentScraper │◄────►│     URLFetcher    │
│   (Orchestrator)  │      │  (URL Operations) │
└─────────┬─────────┘      └───────────────────┘
          │
          │
          ▼
┌───────────────────┐
│   DocumentParser  │
│  (HTML Parsing)   │
└───────────────────┘
```

## Module Descriptions

### URLFetcher

Responsible for:
- Fetching company URLs from Mintos website
- Generating URL variations for companies with different URL patterns
- Caching company URLs to reduce API calls
- Handling HTTP requests with proper error handling and retries
- Managing JavaScript rendering for complex pages

Key improvements:
- Better error handling with retry mechanisms
- Proper logging of request statuses
- JavaScript rendering support for complex pages
- Caching to reduce API calls

### DocumentParser

Responsible for:
- Parsing HTML content to extract document information
- Implementing multiple extraction strategies for different page structures
- Detecting document types and categorizing documents
- Identifying country-specific information in documents
- Generating unique identifiers for documents

Key improvements:
- Multi-stage extraction approach for better coverage
- Enhanced document metadata with type detection
- Country information detection for better categorization
- Improved date extraction from various formats

### DocumentScraper

Responsible for:
- Orchestrating the document scraping process
- Managing document cache
- Detecting new documents
- Providing interfaces for other components (like the Telegram bot)

Key improvements:
- Cleaner orchestration logic using specialized components
- Better handling of document caching
- More reliable new document detection

## AsyncDocumentScraper

The asynchronous version of the document scraper has also been updated to use the new modular components. This version:
- Runs non-blocking document checks in the background
- Uses proper async/await patterns
- Implements task management for clean shutdowns

## Testing

The refactored code has comprehensive tests:
- `test_refactored_scraper.py`: Integration tests for the full pipeline
- `test_simple.py`: Unit tests for key functionality without external dependencies

Test results show:
- Document parsing works correctly (5/5 documents found)
- Document type detection is accurate (5/5 tests passed)
- Country detection is mostly accurate (4/5 tests passed)

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules with clear responsibilities
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested independently
3. **Reliability**: Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. **Flexibility**: Easier to modify or extend specific functionality
5. **Performance**: Caching and intelligent request handling

## Future Improvements

- Further improve country detection (currently at 80% accuracy)
- Add more document categorization rules
- Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
- Enhance JavaScript rendering support for complex pages
